There are several conflicts within the `requirements.txt` file. The primary goal is to merge the dependencies from both branches while using the most recent or flexible version constraints.

  * `requests`: One version pins it to `2.31.0`, while the other uses `>=2.31.0`. The flexible version is better, so the final version should be `requests>=2.31.0`.
  * `pyyaml`: One version pins it to `6.0.2`, while the other uses `>=6.0.1`. The pinned version `6.0.2` is more specific and likely the latest required version, so that should be used.
  * `aiohttp`: The versions are pinned to `3.12.5` in both, so that's a simple merge.
  * `beautifulsoup4`: The versions are `4.13.5` and `>=4.12.0`. The more specific `4.13.5` should be used.
  * `networkx`: One branch adds this dependency, while the other does not. The dependency should be included in the final file.
